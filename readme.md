<h1>@fransjesky/threejs-fox</h1>

A vanilla Threejs project built with Typescript on Vite

## Quick start

```bash
npm install && npm run dev
```

## Usage

This project initially serves as a practice project on how to import custom models, add textures, generate particles, add lighting, shadows, fog, and implement physics. But it also serves as personal documentation on how to implement threejs with typescript.

#### Where can i learn about Threejs?

First of all, I recommend you check out the Threejs website and then get started by reading its [documentation](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber). The documentation is really great. It is easy to understand, and you can learn so much just by reading it.

I do not recommend you learn from Youtube, as most of the tutorials there do not even cover the basics of Threejs (most of them are just teaching you how to setup it, which is a waste of time as you can learn it from the documentation and it is faster).

Lastly, I highly recommend you learn from [Bruno Simon's Threejs Journey](https://threejs-journey.com/). It is a paid course, but you can access it forever, and it would cover almost everything from Threejs, making your own model in Blender (a 3D software), and even R3F (React Three Fiber). The best part is that you can interact directly with Bruno Simon through the Discord server, which makes learning much easier.
